# Computer-Aquisition-and-Control-DAQ-Card
LabVIEW 2016 was used to develop a Virtual Instrument (VI) using a Data Acquisition (DAQ) card. This VI supplies and sources AC voltage to low pass, high pass, and notch filter circuits chosen from Horowitz and Hill: The Art of Electronics. The VI’s purpose was to take a user defined frequency range and analyze the circuits response over those frequencies. This was done by outputting the waveform of the circuit’s input and output voltage on the same graph with respect to time, in order to compare amplitudes. Furthermore, the response of the circuits, or the ratio of output and input voltage was plotted against the frequency to determine the response of the respective circuit. The circuits had to be designed with consideration of the limitations of the NI PCI-3259 DAQ card, as well as the NI SCC-68 connector device used in building this VI, the available electrical components necessary to build the circuits, and the commands available within LabVIEW. The document "DAQ Project Report" explains the VI and and the VI is contained in the file "DAQ Project VI.vi".
